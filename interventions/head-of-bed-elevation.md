# Intervention Name: Head of Bed Elevation

## Mechanism of Action
Head-of-bed elevation utilizes gravity to reduce nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux events. By elevating the upper torso, gastric contents are less likely to traverse the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) during sleep. This position also enhances esophageal acid clearance and decreases the duration of acid exposure in the supine position.

## Key Evidence Summary
Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that elevating the head of the bed significantly decreases supine acid exposure and improves symptom scores in patients with GERD.

### Key Findings
- **DeVault et al. (1999):** In a crossover study, elevating the head of the bed by 6 inches reduced supine acid exposure by 67% compared with a flat position.
- **Kahrilas et al. (1994):** A systematic review concluded that head-of-bed elevation is an effective non-pharmacologic intervention for reducing nocturnal reflux symptoms and esophageal acid contact time.
- **More recent meta-analysis (2018):** Pooled data from seven trials showed a mean reduction of 1.2 hours in supine acid exposure per night with elevation ≥ 6 inches.

## Practical Recommendations
- **How to Implement:** Use bed risers under the head‑end bedposts, a foam wedge placed under the mattress, or a commercially available adjustable bed frame. Pillows alone are insufficient because they flex the neck without raising the torso.
- **Recommended Parameters:** Elevate the head of the bed by **6–8 inches (15–20 cm)**. This corresponds to an angle of approximately **15–20 degrees**.
- **Patient Instructions:** “Place blocks, bricks, or specially designed bed risers under the two head‑end bed legs. Alternatively, use a firm wedge that extends from your hips to your head, not just under the neck. Avoid stacking pillows, as this can increase abdominal pressure and worsen reflux.”

## Potential Limitations
- **Adherence Challenges:** Some patients find sustained elevation uncomfortable or experience back/hip discomfort. Partners may object to the inclined sleeping surface.
- **Conflicting Evidence:** Optimal elevation height is debated; some studies suggest ≥10 inches (25 cm) for maximal benefit, while others find 6 inches sufficient. The ideal angle may vary with individual anatomy and reflux severity.
- **Safety Considerations:** Ensure the bed is stable and the risers are secure to prevent accidental slipping. Caution in patients with mobility issues or balance disorders.
